# There is a relationship between base_volume, spread, volatility of market and tick_sleep... to minimize risk (more volatile market needs wider spread and faster tick for example)
# Likely, an advanced strategy would dynamically adapt those depending on market volatility observed, and results obtained (order filled or not, profit upon filling, etc.)
# Therefore the strategy instance would depend on the exchange + pair...
